# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of pizza sales data using SQL.  
The objective is to extract meaningful business insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends by working with multiple relational tables.

The analysis follows a complete analytics lifecycle, including descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of four relational tables:

- **orders** – Contains order date and time information  
- **order_details** – Stores details about pizzas ordered and quantities  
- **pizzas** – Includes pizza size and price information  
- **pizza_types** – Contains pizza names and category details  

All datasets are available inside the `dataset/` folder.

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Used
- INNER JOINs across multiple tables  
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses  
- Subqueries  
- Window functions (RANK, SUM OVER)
